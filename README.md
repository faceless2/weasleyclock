## Method
1. On the two plastic plates, one of the four holes on both plates is 0.8mm closer to the center. On version 2 of the drawings (uploaded) this is marked with a
small hold next to it, but on version 1 it's not - identify and mark this hole on both plates
2. Glue 4mm ID and 3mm ID bushs inside two of the 6mm bore gears. We now have one gear each with 3mm/4mm/6mm core, five with 5mm core
3. Glue 6mm core gear to 6mm tube, teeth at the end of the tube
4. Glue 5mm core gear to 5mm tube, teeth at the end of the tube
5. Glue 4mm core gear to 4mm tube, teeth 38mm from the end of the tube? or at end?
6. Glue 3mm core gear to 3mm tube, teeth 28mm from the end of the tube
7. Glue 3mm ID, 6mm OD bush to end of 3mm tube nearest the gear
8. Fit 4 remaining 5mm gears to 67x5mm OD tubes, teeth about 10mm in from end. Glue later once meshed.
9. Motors are fitted with couplings and connected to rear plate, as are standoffs (countersink holes a bit) and 6mm ID flanged bush
10. 4 brass tubes are nested, and put into rear plate
11. 4 5mm brass tubes are fitted to motor couplings. The marked hole meshes with the 5mm OD tube, the others can mesh in any order.
12. Fit the bearing and 4 x 5mm ID bushes into the front plate, countersink the screw holes so they're completely recessed and screw to standoffs.
